# DAO with thirdweb

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
To get started follow these commands:

1. Run `npm install` at the root of directory
2. Run `npm start` to start the project


What we did:
âœ… deployed our own custom ERC-20 token
âœ… deployed our own ERC-1155(Fractional NFT) NFT people can mint to join your DAO.
âœ… deployed our own governance contract + treasury.
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by our governance contract.
