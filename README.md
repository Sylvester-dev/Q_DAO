## About the project

Web-based web project3 developed with Next.js, ChakraUI and ThirdWeb. In this application users will be able to be part of the QDAO where they can mint their membership NFT and use the DAO token for decision making within the Q organization.

For this it is necessary to first authenticate using the Metamask wallet and configuring it to use the Rinkeby test network.

QDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity without central leadership. Decisions are made from the bottom up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules that apply on a blockchain. This DAO is developed with 'third website' for decision-making related to the Q Club... 

It has its own Governance Token and Membership NFT.

### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## What we did: <br/>
âœ… deployed our own custom ERC-20 token <br/>
âœ… deployed our own ERC-1155(Fractional NFT) NFT people can mint to join your DAO. <br/>
âœ… deployed our own governance contract + treasury. <br/>
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by our governance contract.
