âœ… deployed our own custom ERC-20 token <br/>
âœ… deployed our own ERC-1155(Fractional NFT) NFT people can mint to join your DAO. <br/>
âœ… deployed our own governance contract + treasury. <br/>
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by our governance contract.
