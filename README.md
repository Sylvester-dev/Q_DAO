What we did:
âœ… deployed our own custom ERC-20 token
âœ… deployed our own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join your DAO.
âœ… deployed our own governance contract + treasury.
âœ… built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.
